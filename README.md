# Wei – Event Booking Platform

Wei is a Flutter-based event booking platform built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns. Developed for Tree Technologies, Wei draws inspiration from platforms like Luma, offering a seamless experience for discovering, booking, and managing events. The app allows users to explore a variety of events—workshops, webinars, meetups, and more—while giving organizers powerful tools for event creation, RSVP tracking, attendee management, and real-time notifications. With a clean, mobile-first interface and robust Flutter implementation, Wei delivers a smooth cross-platform experience tailored for both users and event hosts.
